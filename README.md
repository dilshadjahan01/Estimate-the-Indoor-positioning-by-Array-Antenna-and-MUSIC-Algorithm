# Estimate-the-Indoor-positioning-by-Array-Antenna-and-MUSIC-Algorithm
Generated position estimates X^, y^ from CSI using the MUSIC algorithm and array antenna. In theory, we could provide MÃ—Nsub all "raw" channel coefficients to our neural network and let it directly estimate them from this raw data.
